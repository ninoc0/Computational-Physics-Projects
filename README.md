### 1. Planetary Simulation

The first project we worked on was a simulation of the Earth revolving around the sun using real values. Future updates of this project may add other planetary bodies and will include a write up on how these extra bodies affect those around it.

### 2. Gas Particle Simulation

The next project we are currently working on is a simulation of some n number of particles in a two dimensional box. These particles represent some gas and the next step of this project is to calculate the temperature and pressure of the box in order to test if the ideal gas law works. This project is best viewed on [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m4nR2Jk39BLbNR0E4Hq62_mHSja6oeOr#scrollTo=XM_pJ9Izu9Te&uniqifier=1) and will eventaully include a write up of all the math involved.
